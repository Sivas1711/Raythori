# **Raythori - Connecting Farmers and Buyers**

Raythori is an efficient Agriculture Ecommerce platform designed to connect farmers directly with buyers. Our mission is to eliminate middlemen, ensure fair pricing for farmers, and provide fresh agricultural products to consumers at affordable rates.

---

## **Why Raythori?**

Middlemen often increase costs for consumers and decrease profits for farmers. Raythori addresses this issue by:
- Allowing farmers to freely list their produce.
- Enabling buyers to browse, compare, and purchase products directly from farmers.
- Ensuring fair pricing and promoting local agriculture.

## **Features for Sellers**

Raythori provides a set of features designed to help sellers manage their products, track sales, and manage payments. These are the four key features for sellers:

### **1. Create and Manage Product Listings:**
Sellers can list and manage their agricultural products, including setting prices, adding descriptions, and uploading images. This feature allows sellers to easily update their product availability, description, and pricing, ensuring that buyers always have up-to-date information.

### **2. Order Management:**
Track and manage incoming orders, accept or reject them, and monitor order status. Sellers can ensure timely processing and shipping of orders, providing better service and customer satisfaction.

### **3. Sales Analytics:**
Gain insights into sales performance, top-selling products, and revenue trends. Sales analytics help sellers optimize their business strategies, identify high-demand products, and make informed decisions to grow their business.

### **4. Payment Management:**
Secure payment handling for sellers, enabling them to track earnings and manage withdrawals. Sellers can ensure smooth transactions, track their revenue, and access payments efficiently.
